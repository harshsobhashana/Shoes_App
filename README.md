<h2>📝 Description</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>Shoes App</strong> is a modern, UI-driven mobile shopping application developed using <strong>Flutter</strong>. It is designed to deliver a premium and responsive shopping experience specifically tailored for sneaker and footwear lovers.
</p>

<p>

Though the app doesn’t yet connect to a backend or database, it serves as an ideal foundation for full-scale e-commerce solutions.
</p>

<p>
  The app features a <strong>homepage with featured products</strong>, <strong>beautiful product detail views</strong>, and <strong>intuitive navigation</strong> to showcase how a real shopping app would behave. It also incorporates interactive elements, such as a responsive layout, hero animations, shadow effects, and modern typography to enhance user experience.
